## SeaBadger Material Design WordPress Theme

This WordPress theme is based on [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [MDBootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/),
a Material Design framework built on Bootstrap 4.

The theme implements most of the basic functionality and you can use Bootstrap / MDBootstrap to further
customize it. It also includes a custom widget to display social media icons and recent posts with
thumbnails in grid.

Note: it is not fully complete and you may need to implement certain functionality or contact me via [SeaBadger.io](https://seabadger.io)
